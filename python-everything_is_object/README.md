### `Python - Everything is object` :dart:


* Why Python programming is awesome
* What is an object
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
* What is a reference
* What is an assignment
* What is an alias
* How to know if two variables are identical
* How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
* How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
* What is mutable and immutable
* What are the built-in mutable types
* What are the built-in immutable types
* How does Python pass variables to functions
