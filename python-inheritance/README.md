### `Python - Inheritance` :dart:


* Why Python programming is awesome
* What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
* What is a subclass
* How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
* When can an instance have new attributes
* How to inherit class from another
* How to define a class with multiple base classes
* What is the default class every class inherit from
* How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
* Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
* What is the purpose of inheritance
* What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions




## `Requirements`

`Python Test Cases`

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
* All your modules should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')`
* All your classes should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')`
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')`
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case




### Shell Scripts


* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
* All your files must be executable
