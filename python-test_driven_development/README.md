### `Python - Test-driven development` :dart:

`Learning Objectives `

* Why Python programming is awesome
* What’s an interactive test
* Why tests are important
* How to write Docstrings to create tests
* How to write documentation for each module and function
* What are the basic option flags to create tests
* How to find edge cases


* Why Python programming is awesome
* What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
* What is a subclass
* How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
* When can an instance have new attributes
* How to inherit class from another
* How to define a class with multiple base classes
* What is the default class every class inherit from
* How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
* Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
* What is the purpose of inheritance
* What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions



## `Requirements`

`Python Test Cases`

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
*  All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
*  All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
*  All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
*  All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
*  A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
*  We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!


### Shell Scripts

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
